# SDutility
Want to create a script that is a one-stop shop for Service Desk to run a number of scans and utilities.

Basic idea of my project is to create an easy to use utility that service desk can use that engineers can use to gather the basic troubleshooting information they use day to day, run scans and network reset.

V3.0 has four functions currently; run standard scans (SFC, DISM, etc), gather ip information (ipconfig, tracert, ping, etc), gather system information and reset network adapters.
